# RLE-Encoder
The RLE (Run-Length Encoding) encoder project involves developing a compression algorithm that efficiently represents consecutive identical elements in a data stream by replacing them with a single instance followed by a count of how many times it repeats. This approach aims to reduce the overall size of the data, making it more space-efficient for storage or transmission. The RLE encoder scans the input data and identifies consecutive runs of identical values, encoding them into a compact representation. The project typically requires implementing the encoding algorithm, testing it on various datasets, and assessing its effectiveness in terms of compression ratios and processing speed. RLE encoding is commonly used in image compression, file compression, and other applications where reducing redundancy in data is crucial.
